### Overview of Google Cloud AI and ML Services
- AI Building Blocks provide AI through simple REST calls  

- Cloud AutoML enables training models on custom datasets    

- AI Platform provides end-to-end ML pipelines both on-premises and cloud  
  + customers can use AI platform to perform machine learning techniques all the way from training the models tutoring the models to deploying the models.  

- AI Hub is a Google hosted repository to discover, share, and deploy ML models  

- Google Cloud Platform offers comprehensive set of ML & AI services for beginners and advanced AI engineers
  + It is a collection of artifacts and various resources that can be shared by teams or even the public domain.  

### 1. AI Building Blocks(check the PDF)
- **SIGHT**  
  + Vision: Derive insights from images in the cloud or at the edge.
      = perform object detection or image classification by simply uploading the image or sending the image to the API.

  + Video: Enable powerful content discovery and engaging video experiences.  

- **CONSVERSATION**
  + Dialogflow: Build virtual agent and other conversational experience.    

  + Cloud Text-to-Speech API: Convert text to human-like speech using WaveNet voice.    

  + Cloud Speech-to-Text API: Convert speech to text automatically with outstanding accuracy.  

- **LANGUAGE**
  + Translation: Dynamically detect and translate between languages.

  + Natural Language: Reveal the structure and meaning of text through machine learning.    
    = extract intents and actions from the plain clear text that is actually sent to the API.  

- **STRUCTURED DATA**
  + AutoML Tables: Automatically build and deploy state-of-the-art machine learning models on structured data.  

  + Recommendations AI: Deliver highly personalized product recommendations at scale.  

  + Cloud Inference API: Quickly run large-scale correlations over typed time-series datasets.  

### 2. AutoML
The building blocks provide APIs that you can invoke by sending data, but there is one data point at a time. What if you want to train a custom model but do not want to write complex code about neural networks or artificial neural networks? -> AutoML

- Cloud AutoML enables training high-quality models specific to a business problem  
- Custom machine learning models without writing code  
- Based on Googleâ€™s state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms  
- AutoML Services  
- Sight  
  + Vision  
  + Video Intelligence   
- Language  
  + Natural Language  
  + Translation  
- Structure Data  
  + Tabular data  


> when you send an image of a dog to the building block vision API, you get back a payload that says it is an animal and it is a dog. However, if you have a business problem where you need to identify a specific breed of the dog, cloud vision API, or the building block API doesn't directly support that, you need to train a custom model that can differentiate between one build of the dog versus the other.

> Assuming you have a large data set that is structured into a set of dogs based on the breed and their differences. You can take that data set and use Auto ML to create a custom model so when you send a dog image to the custom model trained through Auto ml, it not only recognizes that as a dog but it also tells you which breed it is because it has been on a data set that had multiple breeds.
