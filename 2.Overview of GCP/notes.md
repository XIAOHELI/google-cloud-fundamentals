## 1. Big Picture of GCP
**Region**: region is a collection of multiple data centers you can associate a zone with a data center and when Google launches a new region it typically has at least two zones.  

**Zone**: zones and the idea of a zone provides higher availability reliability and redundancy to customers when customers launch applications they use more than one zone making their application highly available.  

**network edge locations**: deliver static content which will enhance the user experience.  

### Building blocks of GCP(see the picture from slide, bottom to top)  
#### Three core foundational building blocks  
- 1. **Compute** is the most critical building block of cloud infrastructure.
- 2. **Storage** provides durability and persistence to applications.
- 3. **network** enables communication across multiple applications and services.

#### additional services  
- 1. **Database** includes both no sequel databases and relational database.
- 2. **Data&Analytics** offers business intelligence and data warehouse.

#### google expertise  

- 1. **AI and machine learning** so there are quite a few services that deliver machine learning and artificial intelligence based services for enterprises.

#### For enterprises  
- 1. **Hybride & multi-cloud**
- 2. **API Management**
- 3. **Migration**

#### Security $ DevOps Tools  
- important for all the services and all the applications deployed on GCP.

#### management tools  
- deliver services through which customers can interact and manage their deployments and cloud infrastructure services.
