### APP Engine  
- One of the first compute services from Google (PaaS)   

- Fully managed platform for deploying web apps at scale
  + Fully managed means that user don't have to deal with provisioning, configuring, scaling, managing and securing the platform or infrastructure.
  + Automatically scale the application as request increase.
  + The code will runs in the same context of Google's infrastructure.   

- Supports multiple languages, frameworks, and libraries

- App Engine is available in two environments   
  + Standard   
  + Flexible(complete control over packaging and deployment)  

- Applications deployed in standard environment run in a sandbox   



### Compute Engine   
- give you a choice of virtual machines with a different set of configurations where you take control by logging into the VM installing the software of your choice and treating it like a machine.  

### Kubernetes Engine    
- All about an orchestration platform.  
- fundamental shift that is happening in the infrastructure segment, virtual machines are slowly getting replaced by containers.      
- A platform it's an orchestration engine to manage tens of thousands of containers that are deployed in the cloud.    

### Cloud Functions  
- Represents functions as a service.    
- A server-less environment to execute code where you don't need to launch a VM or package your code as a container.
