###  Overview of GCP Storage Services
-  Why do we need GCP storage services? -> Storage services add persistence and durability to applications.
-  Storage services are classified into three types:
    + Object storage  
    + Block storage  
    + File system  
-  GCP storage services can be used to store:
    +  Unstructured data(e.g. Images,PDF,HTML files,etc)  
    +  Folders and Files(typically migrating from your local on-prem data center)    


### Google Cloud Storage
-  Unified object storage for a variety of applications  
-  Applications can store and retrieve objects through single API  
-  GCS can scale to exabytes of data  
-  GCS is designed for 99.999999999% durability  
   + the change of losing data is almost 0%.  
-  GCS can be used to store high-frequency and low-frequency access of data  
    + storage service that can be used by cloud applications so when you are storing data you write the data using the API s-- and you also retrieve it using the api this is the fundamental difference between dealing with filesystem and an object storage.  
-  Data can be stored within a single region, dual-region, or multi-region
